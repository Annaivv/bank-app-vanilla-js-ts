## 🏦 Example Bank Application

This project is a vanilla JavaScript + TypeScript banking application that simulates basic operations on a user’s bank account.

Users can:

- Log in to a predefined account
- View account balance and transaction history
- Transfer money to other users
- Request a loan
- See automatically calculated summaries (incomes, expenses, total balance)

The application supports localization for currency, dates, and time, adapting formatting based on the user’s locale.

## 🛠 Technical Improvements

This project is a refactor of the "Bankist" app from Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.
I have significantly upgraded the codebase by:

- **TypeScript Migration**: Implemented strict type-checking for better developer experience and fewer bugs.
- **Modular Architecture**: Split the monolithic script into specialized modules.
- **Modern Tooling**: Moved from a standard script tag to **Vite** for optimized bundling and deployment.
